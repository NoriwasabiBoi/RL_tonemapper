# RL_tonemapper

## About

Custom MATLAB tonemapper for a university project.  
Includes a simple GUI with a saturation slider that controls the strength of desaturation and resaturation and a slider for the white point for the reinhard tonemapping.  
Visualizes the 4 main steps of the pipeline in a 2x2 layout:  
1. Normalize  
2. Desaturate  
3. Tonemapping (Reinhard)  
4. Resaturate  

Meant for exploring basic color manipulation techniques in an HDR workflow.
